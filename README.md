# Coding Quiz

## Description 
This timed, multiple chice Code Quiz project is designed to help users practice test-taking techniques and assess their knowledge of JavaScript. This browser-based features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The project aims to provide a polished, user-friendly interface for an comfortable quiz-taking experience. 

It was developed as practice with web APIs, DOM manipulation, and creating dynamic applications.

## Installation 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your code editor of choice.
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.

## Usage 
Click the "Start Quiz" button to begin. The quiz-taker has one minute to answer a series of questions.
Each wrong answer will subtract 10s from the timer. 
Save your score by entering your intials and view it on the leaderboard.

## Future Development 
In the future, the JS could be improved to fix the high score table so that the 'undefined' rows are not appended to the page. The JS could also implement code that will hide and unhide elements on the page more smoothly to improve the user experience. The page is simple in its design, but could still benefit from having the HTML/CSS reworked to achieve a more clean, polished look.
